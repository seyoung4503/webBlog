    The subject called logic circuit is quite interesting.
    When I never know about logic circuit, I had a little misunderstanding
    at the first time.
    Because it looks very complicated and difficult, so I was afraid.


    But one video changed my thought.

    Those are just results made from LED, but I was so impressed. That I had
    a dream to making my own pc.
