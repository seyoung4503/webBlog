    Basically, computers work at binary environment, that means the computers can interact with 0 or 1 signal. Generally 0 signal is equal to off, and 1 signal is equal to on.
    <br><br>
    Obviously our world uses decimal, so we can't intuitively accept computers signal.
    <br><br>
    If we provide decimal number data at hardware level and let the computer do the job, it might be take quite a while.
    <br><br>
    Because the computer should convert decimal number to binary number and compute it.
    <br><br>
    And that's why we need operator which operate binary numbers.
    <br><br>
    But before we deal with operators, we should know how to describe negative numbers in binary environment.
    <br><br>
    <h2>2's complement</h2>
    At first, we should describe 5 to binary number. It is just 00000101.
    Second, we want to calculate 5 - 5.
    <br>
    It is simply equal to 0. And also we can write binary calculation like this.
    <pre>
        00000101
      - 00000101
      = 00000000
    </pre>
    Isn't it simple?
    <br>
    By the way, we want to express this calculation without subtraction like 5 + -(5).
    <br>
    5 + x = 0
    <br><br>
    If we can find number x, it would be -5. And x is equal to 11111011.
    <br><br>
    <pre>
        00000101
      + 11111011
      = 00000000
    </pre>
    We can easily get negative numbers using the previous expression.
    <br><br>
    And the previous progress has the rules to convert pos to neg.
    First, both 0 and 1 need to swap each others. And you should plus 1 to that number.
    <br>
    That is how to convert pos to neg number and it called 2's complement law.

        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>OR operator</h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\세영\Desktop\web\blog\orGate.jpg" alt="orGate" width="200px">
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>x</td>

        <td>z = x + y</td>

        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>

      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>NOT operator</h3>
      <img src="C:\Users\세영\Desktop\web\blog\notGate.jpg" alt="notGate" width="200px">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>x</td>
          <td>z = x'</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      As you can see, AND operation always has a result value of 1 when all signals inputted are 1.
      <br>
      And OR operation always gives 0 signal when input signals are all 0.
      <br>
      Obviously, NOT operation gives the signal opposite to input.
